After reading the book “14 Habits of Highly Productive Programmers,” I decided to make a brief summary of this reading, focusing on the best habits adopted by developers from large companies and startups. The purpose of this article is to assist both beginner and senior programmers in their journey to becoming successful professionals.

**Note:** At the end of the article, there is a phrase that motivated me to create this post and will also motivate you.

**Note 2:** There is a list of TODOs after detailing Habit 14. Each TODO refers to the habit of its respective number, for example, TODO 1 refers to Habit 1, TODO 2 to Habit 2, and so forth.

## Habit 1 — Look for the Signs

In this first habit covered in the book, the author mentions two terms used in English, **FOMO** (_the fear of missing out_) or "The fear of missing something" and **JOMO** (_the joy of missing out_) or "The joy of missing something." In FOMO, he points out how we are always looking to learn new technologies or frameworks, change operating systems or software just because they are trendy or said to be better, and that the current ones will depreciate over time. For Zeno Rocha (author) **_there is no best tool_**, we should practice JOMO and be happy with what we already know, but obviously not be content with everything we've learned. We should practice the subtle art of saying 'no' daily. No to the new library. No to that more sophisticated platform. **Say 'no' more to be able to say 'yes' to what really matters to you.**

# Habit 2 — Focus on the Fundamentals

Fundamentals are very important for any activity, and development and programming are no different. If you decide to become a great developer, it's important to understand the main concepts, such as algorithms, logic, networks, accessibility, security, and user experience. Knowing all this will help you create the next ten complex apps you will develop in the future.

# Habit 3 — Teaching Equals Learning

At a certain point in my life, I started to realize that the more I taught something to people, the more I abstracted about the topics covered, and reading this chapter reinforced this in my mind even more. Believe it or not, this is my first article, and I created it purely out of motivation from reading this chapter, where the author shares his experience as a speaker with over 100 lectures in his portfolio and how this helped him achieve success in his career. **If you really want to learn something, you need to teach it.** Whether in articles, blogs, classes, lectures, or just a code review. Every type of teaching is a guarantee that you will learn more than if you were learning alone without transmitting that knowledge to someone.

# Habit 4 — Be Boring

In this chapter, the author initially talks about the effort we must apply in our daily tasks to become better every day. A better programmer is one who is constantly evolving and always working towards improving as a professional, **constancy!!**. In this habit "Be Boring," he emphasizes through the analogy that development is an infinite game, that is, a game that never ends and is full of new variants all the time within patterns of constant activities that we must face (Figure below). Thus, programmers who play the infinite game are less concerned with intensity and more focused on consistency.

# Habit 5 — Do It for Your Future Self

Who hasn't experienced the feeling of writing code and, after six months, looking at that code and wondering: "Why on earth did I do this?" or "Wow, why didn't I do it this way?" This is normal and happens because it depends a lot on the environment or moment we are dealing with at that time of coding. It might be due to being in a toxic work environment or under pressure from the project manager for quick feature delivery. Although we experience this feeling, we always have to keep in mind that the next time we start to develop, we should ask ourselves: "Will my future self understand the intention of this code?" Below is a figure showing how the quality of the work environment influences the quality of our code.

# Habit 6 — Your 9 to 5 is Not Enough

If you think that working on your 9 to 5 job projects is enough to become a great programmer, I'm sorry to say, but you are mistaken. Our job is probably not enough to showcase our full potential; we need to study and, if possible, take our work problems home (thinking about how to solve them, for example). I'm not saying that we should only focus on work and studies; it is extremely possible and very important that we try to maintain a balance between work, studies, and family. Whenever possible, study about daily work problems and which skills we can improve.

# Habit 7 — Master the Dark Side of the Force

Programming in itself is something very powerful, but it's not all roses. For software to really make sense, be useful to users, and deliver productivity to the team, it needs to be fully aligned with the problems that the business faces, and that's where business rules come in. They serve to guide and restrict operations within the company and it is from these business rules that software and enterprise systems emerge.

Often, an employee who has a broad knowledge of a company's business rules is much more valuable than some employees in important positions, simply because they can solve problems quickly or have a better solution. Being a good developer is important, but knowing how business rules work is fundamental for software development.

Knowing how the business rules of your company work, it will be possible to:

1 — **Save your time** by identifying the problems of your company. The better you understand the business, the better you will be at solving these problems.

2 — **Avoid complex codes** and apply simple solutions to problems. Often, we want to develop extremely abstract or flexible codes, but this is not always necessary. Knowing about the business rules helps a lot in this.

3 — **Better prioritize micro-decisions,** which will consequently help you find critical functionalities, point out where you should spend most of your time, and likely enable you to write high-quality code, preventing future refactoring.

**"Remember, a person who knows how to program is powerful, a person who knows how to program and understands how business works is unstoppable."**

# Habit 8 — Side Projects

Did you know that Twitter, Craigslist, and Slack all started as side projects? Side projects are not just something to look at as an opportunity for a new innovative solution or your future venture; they are a great opportunity to expand your portfolio, to create a resume and showcase your skills. Additionally, they allow you to get hands-on experience to try and learn methodologies or approaches that are not possible to implement in your current job. Since they are personal projects, there is no pressure, schedules, or specifications imposed by anyone, meaning you can use all your creativity and have fun doing it.

*Subject you like x Skill you want to learn = Side Projects*

Questions to ask yourself to help choose a personal project:

1. _Do I really like this subject, field, type of work?_
2. _Am I willing to spend at least five years working on this idea?_
3. _Can I execute this idea completely on my own?_
4. _Is this particular idea better than others I've had in the past? Is there another idea that could use my time better?_
5. _Do I have this problem personally or am I solving it for someone else? (This question will help you better understand the audience for whom you are building the solution)._
6. _Why am I excited about this idea right now?_

It is crucial to understand your motivation. Do you want to learn a new technology? Want to make money? Or are you just distracting yourself from other problems? **Be honest with yourself.**

# Habit 9 — Mario or Sonic?

Mario and Sonic were part of many people's childhood. They were heroes at the same time but on different consoles. Both were great heroes in their respective "worlds". Mario was always jumping from one place to another, while Sonic was always ready to face the biggest challenges he could find.

When we are starting our careers, we tend to change jobs frequently in a short period of time. There is nothing wrong with this, but it turns us into professionals with many superficial skills. On the other hand, the more time we spend on a project, the more opportunities we will have to make a significant long-term impact on our careers.

Both (Mario and Sonic) are incredible and, in the end, both have the potential to save the world. But if you had to choose between the two, be constant and resilient like Sonic.

# Habit 10 — Active Listening

Dealing with clients in the business world is very complicated, as in many cases they often don't know what they really want, which greatly complicates the decisions of us developers. In some companies, developers do not always have direct contact with the client for requirement gathering, meaning that these requirements will come through someone else (analyst or project manager), which can hinder understanding and transmitting this information. However, it's not only in requirement gathering that misinterpretation of ideas can occur; this misunderstanding can also happen among developers when trying to assist someone who needs support to clarify doubts for the development of a specific feature. Therefore, it is extremely important that we actively listen to others, only then can we obtain an understanding of any valuable information and absorb critical details to solve the problems of a complex application.

Regardless of the conversation you are having, practice the habit of actively listening. Not just listening to respond, I mean **really listening**, really trying to understand what the other person is trying to convey. Everyone you know is fighting a battle that you don't know about. Always be kind.

# Habit 11 — Do Not Underestimate

_"It will only take 5 minutes." — Every developer on the planet_

The biggest problem with delayed sprint deliveries is the wrong estimation of the time for task completion. Do you know why we are so bad at software estimates? For the following reasons:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*F01vv_Qj0J16tGyeb7vWkg.jpeg)

1. **We want to impress others** with our agility or ability to code and deliver solutions quickly.
2. **We forget that it's not just about code** and we must remember the entire software development lifecycle such as: compiling code, writing tests, documenting fixes, resolving conflicts, and attending daily meetings.
3. **We don't focus on just one thing** and divide our attention among several projects at the same time. Our mind only has one Thread and works best using it exclusively for just one specific task.
4. **We believe that everyone is the same**, when in fact each person thinks and works differently. Thus, each one has their own time for completing a specific task.
5. **We can't handle pressure**, forgetting that sometimes the problem is not directly related to us and that the pressure that reaches us can be the result of a domino effect coming from higher positions.

Next time you are estimating a duration for a task, double or triple this estimated time. It's better to estimate a longer date and deliver before the deadline than to deliver late and disappoint your manager.

# Habit 12 — Specialist vs. Generalist

Should I be a specialist in a specific subject or a generalist and know what's necessary to solve any type of problem? The answer will depend on a self-analysis. You need to know yourself, look inward, and think about which types of tasks motivate you the most during your workday. Take a look at the following list and see who you identify with the most.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*ii5dnU8ZBVgUSqTGNNYN2A.jpeg)

Specialist — Pros
-------------------

* You can earn a very good salary in a specific field.
* You will usually be recognized as a technical authority on a certain subject.
* You need to stay up-to-date in just one platform/language.
* Companies are always looking for people specialized in a specific field.

Specialist — Cons
----------------------

* It can be difficult to find a position if your specialization is very limited.
* If the chosen technology is at risk of becoming outdated, you may have to start from the bottom again, and that will be difficult.
* Your knowledge may be very dependent on the company, which will make it difficult to apply the same skills elsewhere.
* If there is an urgent need to use another technology, you will probably take longer to complete a specific task.

Specialist — Job Opportunities
---------------------------------------

* Senior positions, especially in large companies.
* Research projects in universities.
* Freelancer in a specific field.

**Now, let's take a look at how these lists compare to those of a generalist.**

Generalist — Pros
------------------

* You are accustomed to learning new technologies quickly.
* There is a wide variety of opportunities you can seek in different sectors.
* If you need a new job, it's more flexible and easier to transition.
* If you need to change the context to a different type of task, there's a chance of finding a solution faster.

Generalist — Cons
---------------------

* It's difficult to stay updated in several different languages and technologies.
* You may take a long time to solve complex and specific technology problems.
* It's hard to reach a leadership position if you are constantly changing fields.
* Although it's easier to find a new position, it can be hard to show that you are the best candidate.

Generalist — Job Opportunities
---------------------------------------

* Startups/Early-stage companies.
* Consulting opportunities.
* Starting your own business.

# Habit 13 — Control Your Variables

_"The only thing you sometimes have control over is your perspective. You don't have control over your situation. But you have a choice about how you view it." — Chris Pine_

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*jtD_Gjlcc3iqWyp1iAlCVw.jpeg)

Stop wasting time on variables that are out of your control. Focus on the variables you can control.

Variables You CAN Control
----------------------------------

* Your thoughts
* Who your friends are
* What you eat and drink
* How you spend your money
* What you do with your time
* How you treat your body
* How much you appreciate the things you already have

Variables You CANNOT Control
--------------------------------------

* The weather
* The economy
* Public health
* How people treat you
* What people think about you
* What people like or dislike
* What happened in the past

# Habit 14 — Stop Waiting

No one is ever fully satisfied with life. You will notice, from the poorest to the richest, there is always something missing to achieve or something to complain about.

"This country is horrible, I need to move as soon as possible..."

"I have an incredible idea, I need to put it into practice..."

There's nothing wrong with that. Wishing for a better future for oneself is a basic principle of being human. The problem is what follows these phrases.

"... but I don't know another language."

"... but I don't have time."

Only a few people have the courage and determination to face these challenges. The only thing that prevents you from achieving something is yourself.

Do you want to invest in an idea? Then how many hours are you dedicating to this project? Can you wake up an hour earlier? Can you sleep 30 minutes later? And can you shorten your lunch break?
