**Tik Tech** was born with the purpose of helping developers learn essential features of Node.js and Python frameworks and libraries, through automatically generated explanatory videos. This project seeks not only to facilitate access to information but also to explore the possibility of evolving into a course platform, making programming learning more accessible and transparent, especially for those who do not have access to paid programming courses.

Currently, Tik Tech uses technologies like Puppeteer, AWS Polly, OpenAI API, and FFmpeg to generate and compile explanatory videos on how to use different frameworks and libraries. Moreover, it features a frontend developed with Vite, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS, and IndexedDB, and utilizes Socket.io for efficient communication between the frontend and backend during the video generation stages.

**Although the idea is not to focus 100% on AI to generate the content, it can be a great facilitator to help us achieve this goal**

### Contribution

This project is open source and represents just an initial milestone of something that can have significant proportions with community support. If you are a tech aspirant and love programming, contribute to make this idea a reality. I believe that together we can create a valuable tool for the developer community and help break the false promise of "learning programming in 6 months and earning 10k" that many online courses propagate.

If you believe in the power of open education and the democratization of programming learning, I invite you to contribute to the Tik Tech project. Whether by helping with development, suggesting improvements, or sharing this project with others, all help is welcome!

To start contributing, visit our repository on GitHub, explore the documentation, and feel free to open issues, send pull requests, or even get in touch to discuss ideas on how we can take Tik Tech forward.

Let's build together a tool that can really make a difference in the lives of many developers!
