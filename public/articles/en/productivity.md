I have been trying since 2020 to achieve this productivity that was sold to me. I always wanted financial success to give a better life to my parents and to live comfortably, without worrying about money and enjoying the comfort it can offer. I discovered that **productivity does not exist**, at least not in the way I imagined. Everyone has their own perception of what it is. I used to think it was doing a lot in a short period of time; in part, this is right, but it's not just that.

According to one of the most sophisticated autocompletes on the internet, known as "ChatGPT", productivity is a measure of efficiency that evaluates the amount of output produced in relation to the amount of inputs used. In an economic context, it generally refers to the production of goods and services relative to the inputs used, such as labor, capital, and natural resources. In other words, **the more you produce with the same or fewer resources available, the more productive you will be**.

Unfortunately, many internet influencers and coaches romanticize productivity with methodologies that don't work, and they end up generalizing and giving us the impression that it's very easy to maintain life at 220 volts 100% of the time and be 100% productive. In truth, it's not how it works. Everyone has their own lifestyle, their own problems, each individual's body is different in chemical compounds, each brain is composed of different amounts of neurotransmitters; some people function better during the day, others at night, etc.

We are a system, just like any other type of system in the universe. Let's make a simple analogy, haha, **imagine that your body is a software system**. How do you want to increase the performance and efficiency of a system without knowing every part that composes it? Without knowing what needs to be refactored? Without this knowledge, you can't even properly plan what really needs to be improved or added as a feature.

However, it's **this that we need to pay attention to**, ourselves. We need to discover ourselves, get to know ourselves better, know our limits, find out what we really like, try new things whenever possible. Of course, doing all this in the present, just enjoying the moment and focusing on the process. Only then will we discover the path we want to tread, plan our tasks and goals, and if what we are doing is right. It's a hard search for self-knowledge, but it will surely be worth it in the end.

Recapping the previous analogy, unlike a software system, our body can only be created once, you can't remake a new one from scratch. So our goal is not to let it become a **legacy system**, because that's where the danger lies, imagine your body abandoned, functioning only sometimes, living on makeshift solutions (addictions), filling the system with more and more junk, and trying to function at full steam. Burnout is the result of all this. So maybe it's time to look at your system and find the points for improvement, make the refactors (changes in habits, for example) patiently, of course, refactors if necessary hehe. Looking at yourself will surely help you achieve your goals and objectives.

***"- I see, but what about productivity?"***. For me, when you know yourself and take care of your body, you know your limits, you know why you want something, you know how to achieve it, you know the resources you have or need to reach it, and you know what this "something" is. I continue to strive to know myself more and more and to take better care of my body every day that passes. I have some tips that have been working well.

1. **Seek a professional for therapies**: It's very important to have a professional who knows how to listen to you, who won't judge you and will only help you discover yourself and give advice that makes sense for you. It's not on the first therapist that you will identify with, so look until you find a professional who really helps you.
2. **Sleep 7 to 8 hours**: This will rest you to face the day.
3. **Practice physical activities**: Whatever you want and find easier. Whether running in the street, biking, jumping rope, or going to the gym if you like.
4. **Improve your diet**: Eliminate fried foods, fast foods, and pastas from your routine. If necessary, seek a nutritionist to help you and if necessary even prescribe a multivitamin.
5. **Plan your daily tasks**: I have been using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/pt-BR) for this and it has worked very well, but find your way of planning your tasks and your day, whether on paper or in the notepad of your cell phone.
6. **Don't start everything at once**: Don't take this list and do everything at once, start slowly, trying to do one of these tips per week or every 15 days, acquiring a habit can take time, it requires patience.
7. **Delete social media**: There's nothing useful on social networks for those who want to evolve.

I hope I have helped you in some way, any additions, criticisms, or suggestions can be left in the comments, thank you for reading. ❤️
